# Text_Generation

Create a good model is not enough to provide reliable results. Defining a complete workflow requires a lot of effort and is a
crucial to increase the accuracy of the model itself.

The focus of this challenge is on five different points:
- **Collect and explore all the lyrics** in the dataset to consequently **integrate more data** coming from external sources
- **Clean and normalize all the text** coming from the different lyrics
- **Encode data** in an readable and efficient format to feed them in the models
- **Develop and run** multiple different **models**
- **Test the performance** of the models using different metrics
